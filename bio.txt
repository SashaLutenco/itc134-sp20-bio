Sasha, Alexandru Lutenco 
I am a hardworking professional with excellent customer service, and eager learning attitude, and a passion for creating change in the tech industry of tomorrow. From a foreigner to a new American citizen, I have experienced the greatest parts of freedom and opportunities that the states have to offer. Over seven years of working in the food and beverage industry have created various avenues to learn effective communication, multi-tasking, and the importance of structured teamwork. My Linkedin offers expansive details about my professional work experience and the other skills I have obtained from each. 

I am a current student at Year Up and strive to find a fitting internship opportunity at a tech company where I can expand into a future career. I'm interested in the software testing field and I'm currently working on the necessary fundamentals. In the next five years, I see myself graduating from the program and continuing my further studies in order to get more knowledge about the subject. After getting my education, I see myself using my experience to help future companies in growing their business.
